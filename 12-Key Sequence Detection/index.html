  /*
    .splice(start, deleteCount)
    the .splice() function will at one point eliminate the item at the first index of the array.
    Since the "start" value of the function is set to a negative number above the total length of
    the array the change in the array will begin that many elements from the end of the array.
    When .push() pushes another value to the array the value appears to the right of the array.
    With the first element of the array removed the array appears to have its elements shifting
    to the left.
